P4 Objectives:

Task 1:
 add new attributes to proc struct definition in proc.h
  tickets
  stride
  pass
  ticks
  remain
 create a new global constant STRIDE1 - determine where to define this
 add global vars - determine where to define these
 may be able to init these with their definition?
  global_tickets
  global_stride
  global_pass
 initialize these values when creating a proc in proc.c
 determine when, where, and how to update all these vars (context switch?)

Task 2:
 deterministic scheduling of proc with lowest pass
  tie-break with total runtime (ticks)
   tie-break that with pid
 need to figure out where to implement scheduler (looks like a job for claude)
 updating new proc and global attrs could also be dealt with here, as this
 is where the actual context switch will occur

Task 3:
 create a new system call
 this should *hopefully* go smoothly as it is what we did in p2

Task 4:
 another system call
 pstat - update this each time you update the scheduler info for a proc

Task 5,6:
 testing, worry about after 1-4
